# Getting Started with Jekyll and GitHub Pages

Jekyll is a powerful static site generator that's perfect for creating blogs, documentation sites, and portfolios. When combined with GitHub Pages, you get free hosting for your static websites.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. It takes your content written in Markdown, Liquid templates, HTML, and CSS, and builds a complete static website that you can serve on any web server.

### Key Features:

- **Markdown Support**: Write your content in Markdown for easy formatting
- **Liquid Templating**: Use Liquid templating engine for dynamic content
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with plugins
- **GitHub Pages Integration**: Deploy automatically to GitHub Pages
- **Themes**: Use beautiful pre-built themes like Chirpy

## Setting Up Your First Jekyll Site

### Prerequisites

1. **Ruby** (version 2.5 or higher)
2. **Bundler** gem
3. **Git** for version control

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Install Jekyll and Bundler
gem install jekyll bundler

# Create a new Jekyll site
jekyll new my-awesome-blog

# Navigate to your site directory
cd my-awesome-blog

# Build and serve your site locally
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Choosing a Theme

While Jekyll comes with a default theme called "minima", there are many beautiful themes available:

- **Chirpy**: Clean, responsive theme perfect for technical blogs
- **Minimal Mistakes**: Feature-rich theme with lots of customization options
- **Beautiful Jekyll**: Simple and elegant theme
- **Academic**: Perfect for researchers and academics

## Writing Your First Post

Jekyll posts are written in Markdown and stored in the `_posts` directory. The filename must follow this format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

### Front Matter

Every post starts with YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2025-07-26 10:00:00 +0000
categories: [Category1, Category2]
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
---
```

### Content

After the front matter, write your content in Markdown:

```markdown
# Your Main Heading

This is a paragraph with **bold text** and *italic text*.

## Subheading

- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3

### Code Examples

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository named `username.github.io`
2. Push your Jekyll site to the repository
3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
4. Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io`

## Tips for Success

1. **Write Regularly**: Consistency is key to building an audience
2. **Use Categories and Tags**: Organize your content for better navigation
3. **Optimize for SEO**: Use descriptive titles and meta descriptions
4. **Add Images**: Visual content makes posts more engaging
5. **Enable Comments**: Use Disqus or other commenting systems for engagement

Jekyll combined with GitHub Pages provides a powerful, free platform for blogging and creating websites. With its Markdown support, theme system, and automatic deployment, it's an excellent choice for developers and content creators.
